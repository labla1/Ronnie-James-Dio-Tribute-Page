        <p class="text">Ronald James Padavona (July 10, 1942 – May 16, 2010), known professionally as Ronnie James Dio
            or
            simply Dio, was
            an American heavy metal singer-songwriter and composer, and was also known for popularizing the sign of the
            <em>horns</em> in heavy metal. He fronted or founded numerous groups throughout his career, including
            <strong>Rainbow</strong>, <strong>Black Sabbath</strong>, <strong>Dio</strong>, and <strong>Heaven &
                Hell</strong>.</p>
        <p class="text">Though his parents were from Cortland, New York, Dio was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
            where his family
            resided for his father's service in the U.S. Army during World War II; they soon returned to Cortland. Dio's
            music career began there in 1957 as part of the Vegas Kings (later Ronnie and the Rumblers). In 1967, he
            formed the rock band Elf, which became a regular opening act for Deep Purple. In 1975, Deep Purple guitarist
            Ritchie Blackmore founded the band Rainbow and hired Dio to be his lead singer where the band released three
            studio albums. Dio quickly emerged as one of heavy rock's pre-eminent vocalists. In 1979, Dio replaced Ozzy
            Osbourne as Black Sabbath's lead singer and appeared on three studio albums with the band which met with
            success: Heaven & Hell (1980), Mob Rules (1981) and Dehumanizer (1992). In 1982, he left the band to form
            the band Dio, with two albums certified platinum by RIAA. In 2006, he founded the band Heaven & Hell with
            ex-bandmate Tony Iommi. Dio was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2009, from which he died the following
            year.</p>
        <p class="text">
            Dio is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal artists of all time. He is
            known for popularizing the "Metal Horns" hand gesture in metal culture and his medieval-themed song
            lyrics. According to a version provided by the singer himself, the act derives directly from the
            classic Italian apotropaic gesture, which his grandmother usually did. Dio had a powerful, versatile vocal
            range and was capable of singing both hard rock and lighter ballads. He was awarded the <b>"Metal Guru
                Award"</b>
            by Classic Rock Magazine in 2006. He was also named the "Best Metal singer" at the Revolver Golden Gods
            Awards in 2010 and ranked as the genre's best vocalist in 2013 by music journalist Sacha Jenkins.
